Modular backup script written in python

INSTALLATION

   NOTE: I recommend using virtualenv, but nothing prevents you installing it
         into the root system

   Requirements
   ------------

      When installing this package, it will build the MySQL and Postgres
      clients. So you'll need the necessary headers, plus gcc on your machine.

      For Ubuntu, run the following:

         sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev python-dev \
                              build-essential

   Installation procedure
   ----------------------

      - Download the latest package from http://www.github.com/exhuma/pickup
        I recommend using the latest tagged version, but if you want bleeding
        edge, you may also download the "master" branch.

      - untar the package

        tar xzf exhuma-pickup-<version number+hash>.tar.gz

      - enter the folder

        cd exhuma-pickup-<version number+hash>

   When not using virtualenv, you may skip this section
   ----------------------------------------------------

      NOTE: If you don't have virtualenv, run the following:

            sudo apt-get install python-setuptools && easy_install virtualenv

      - create a virtualenv

        virtualenv --no-site-packages /path/to/your/env

      - activate the environment

        source /path/to/your/env/bin/activate

   Without virtualenv
   ------------------

      - run the installer

        python setup.py install

   Finished & Trying things out
   ----------------------------

      The script is now installed in you system's binary path as "pickup". When
      using virtualenv, this will be /path/to/your/env/bin, otherwise it will
      most likely be /usr/local/bin

      You may now deactivate the virtualenv by entering "deactivate". In the
      future it will no longer be necessary to activate the environment
      manually. The executable script will run automatically in the proper
      environment.

      To see if everything worked as expected, you may run

         /path/to/your/env/pickup --help

      or simply (if it's on your $PATH)

         pickup --help
